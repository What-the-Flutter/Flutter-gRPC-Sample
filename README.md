# gRPC Demo

Demonstration of the gRPC protocol with a Dart server and a Flutter client.

## Why gRPC?

[gRPC](https://grpc.io) is an alternative to HTTP-JSON which sends structured binary data over [HTTP/2](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/) instead of plaintext JSON, resulting in performance increases and more portable models. This is accomplished through the use of [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) for model development.
